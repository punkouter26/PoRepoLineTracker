/// Production sign-in gate for PAGE navigations.
///
/// <para>In Production an unauthenticated browser asking for an app route is sent to the app's own
/// <c>/login</c> page. In Development and Test this is a no-op, so local runs and the E2E tiers
/// work unauthenticated — which is also why nothing in those tiers exercises the behaviour below,
/// and why it is unit-tested directly.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It redirects to /login, not to the OAuth provider.</b> It used to call
/// <c>ChallengeAsync</c>, which sent the browser straight to
/// <c>github.com/login/oauth/authorize</c>. Two things were wrong with that. The branded
/// <c>/login</c> page — which exists, and is the only place that explains what the app wants
/// access to — was never seen by anyone. And the installed PWA declares
/// <c>start_url: "/"</c>, so launching it navigated OUT of the app's scope on the first request,
/// which breaks the standalone window and any offline start. Sign-in still ends at GitHub; the
/// user gets there by pressing the button on <c>/login</c>, which hits <c>/auth/login</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It does not touch /api.</b> Those routes are already deny-by-default through the
/// authorization FallbackPolicy, and the cookie handler's <c>OnRedirectToLogin</c> already turns an
/// unauthenticated API request into a 401 rather than a redirect. Blanket-401ing the whole prefix
/// here ran *before* routing, so it could not tell a real endpoint from a typo and answered 401 for
/// both — a misspelled client URL surfaced as "you are logged out" instead of "no such route".
/// Letting the request through to routing means the catch-all in ApiEndpointExtensions can answer
/// 404.</para>
