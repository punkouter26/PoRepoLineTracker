/// <para><b>Cost, and how it is kept bounded.</b> Scoring a repository means walking its whole tree
/// and parsing every C# file — seconds each — so doing that for every repository on every page load
/// would be the most expensive request in the app. Two things keep it in hand. Repositories with no
/// analysed commits, and those whose clone is not on this host, are settled by a storage lookup and
/// a <c>Directory.Exists</c>: they cost nothing and are returned as unmeasured rows. And the
/// remainder are walked once each, sequentially — the work is CPU-bound, so running it in parallel
/// on the shared web host would trade a slow page for a stalled one.</para>
///
/// <para>Ordering is highest health first, so the list reads as a leaderboard. Unmeasured rows
/// sort last regardless of direction: they are information, not a verdict, and letting a repository
/// with no score sit among the graded ones would imply a ranking it never earned.</para>
