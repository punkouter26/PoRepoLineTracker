/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> Twelve assertions in ChartAndShellUiTests — axis titles, tick
/// labels, distinct date formatting, the dark-theme chart surface — each opened with
/// <c>Skip.If(no chart rendered)</c>. Charts only render for a signed-in user with analysed
/// repositories, and the suite's fake user has none, so the whole group skipped itself on every
/// run. A suite that reports "45 passed, 12 skipped" reads as healthy while covering no chart at
/// all.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why synthetic rather than a real analysis.</b> The genuine path clones a repository
/// from GitHub and walks its commits: minutes of wall-clock, a network dependency, and history
/// that changes under the test. The chart assertions need specific SHAPES — a handful of days to
/// catch duplicate axis labels, a full year to catch a crowded one — which real history cannot be
/// asked for. Writing commit rows directly gives both, deterministically, in well under a second.
/// It exercises the same storage, the same queries and the same rendering; only the commit walk
/// is skipped, and that has its own tests.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Guardrail.</b> Mapped only under <c>IsDevelopment()</c>, alongside the other dev
