# Azure App Service startup script for PoRepoLineTracker.
#
# The built-in DOTNETCORE|10.0 runtime image ships without git, but GitClient shells out to
# the git CLI for clone/pull (LibGit2Sharp is used only for local object-store reads, because
# its native network stack SIGABRTs in this container). Without git, every analysis fails with
# "git is not installed or not in PATH".
#
# This script only takes effect once it is the App Service startup command:
#   az webapp config set -n <app> -g <rg> --startup-file "/home/site/wwwroot/startup.sh"

# NOTE: deliberately NOT `set -e`. A failed apt-get must not stop the site from booting —
# a running site with broken analysis beats a container that never starts.
