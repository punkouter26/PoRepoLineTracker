/// <summary>
/// One commit's code-health figures, memoised forever.
///
/// <para><b>Keyed on the commit, not on the month or the repository's "current" state.</b> A commit
/// is immutable: the tree at <c>abc1234</c> will contain the same bytes in a year, so every figure
/// derived from it — maintainability, complexity, line counts, the combined score — is a constant.
/// Keying on the SHA means the value is computed at most once ever, and the same row answers both
/// the repository's current report and any point on its monthly trend. Keying on the month instead
/// would have recomputed the same commit under a second name every time it happened to be the one
/// nearest a different boundary.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What it replaces.</b> Code health was computed on demand and thrown away, so opening a
/// report re-walked the whole tree and re-parsed every C# file — seconds each time, for an answer
/// that cannot have changed. A twenty-four-month chart made that twenty-four times worse. This is
/// the same reasoning that already puts <see cref="CommitLineCountEntity"/> in storage rather than
/// recounting lines per commit on every view.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It also outlives the clone.</b> Computing a report needs the working checkout; the
/// deployed F1 App Service has a small, recyclable filesystem, so the clone is often simply not
/// there. Once a commit's row is written the figure is answerable from storage with no clone at
/// all — the difference between a chart that works on Azure and one that does not.</para>
///
/// <para>Partitioned by repository so the whole memo loads in ONE query. Reading it per commit
/// inside a loop is exactly the mistake that got <c>CommitExistsAsync</c> deleted: a point read per
/// SHA turned a 4,000-commit repository into 4,000 round-trips.</para>
