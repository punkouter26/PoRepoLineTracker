/// Visual Studio's Code Metrics for C#, computed from the Roslyn SYNTAX tree alone.
///
/// <para><b>What this is, against what the rest of the app does.</b> <see cref="CodeMetricsAnalyzer"/>
/// counts line-oriented proxies across a dozen languages — it never parses anything, which is what
/// lets it treat Python and Razor alike. This does the opposite for the one language it
/// understands: a real C# parse, producing the same figures the Code Metrics window reports. Both
/// exist because neither covers the other's case.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why four metrics and not six.</b> Maintainability Index, Cyclomatic Complexity, Lines
/// of Source code and Lines of Executable code are all decidable from the syntax tree. Halstead
/// volume — the input that made the Maintainability Index look unreachable — is purely lexical:
/// it counts operator and operand TOKENS, so it needs no symbols. Depth of Inheritance and Class
/// Coupling genuinely do need a resolved compilation, because a base type or a referenced type can
/// live in another assembly, and nothing in a syntax tree can follow that.</para>
///
/// <para><b>And why the resolved compilation is not attempted.</b> Reaching it means MSBuildWorkspace,
/// which means the .NET SDK and MSBuild present at runtime and a restore of the repository being
/// measured. The deployed App Service is a runtime-only DOTNETCORE|10.0 container on an F1 plan —
/// no SDK, 1 GB of storage, a daily CPU quota — so it cannot build anything. Building an arbitrary
/// repository also EXECUTES that repository's code, through MSBuild targets and NuGet scripts,
/// which is not something a shared web host should do on a stranger's behalf. The MSBuildLocator
/// route additionally requires Microsoft.Build packages that currently carry high-severity
/// advisories, and this solution builds with TreatWarningsAsErrors. If those two metrics are ever
/// wanted, the honest way is an opt-in local agent, not a web request.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The Maintainability Index is per MEMBER, then averaged.</b> This is the one thing that
/// is easy to get wrong and produces a plausible-looking number when you do. The published formula
/// was calibrated on a single unit of code; fed repository-wide totals instead, the
/// <c>0.23 * complexity</c> term alone reaches several hundred and every repository of any size
/// scores 0. Measured per member and averaged, this repository scores 87 — which is the band
/// Visual Studio puts it in.</para>
