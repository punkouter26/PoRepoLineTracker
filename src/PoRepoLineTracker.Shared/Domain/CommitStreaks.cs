/// and the "since you were last here" digest banner — and while both currently live in the
/// Insights slice, slices are forbidden from referencing each other, so the next surface to want a
/// streak would have no shared home to reach for. Without one
/// home each would have grown its own copy, and a streak that reads 12 on one page and 11 on
/// another is indistinguishable from a data bug. This is the same reasoning that put
/// <see cref="RepositoryTotals"/> here.</para>

/// <para>Both methods take the set of days that had at least one commit, so the caller decides
